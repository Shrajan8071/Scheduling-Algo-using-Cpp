# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms

This project implements various operating system scheduling algorithms in C++. The implemented algorithms include:

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

## File Structure

- `fcfs.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm.
- `priority.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Priority Scheduling algorithm.
- `RR.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm.
- `SJF.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm.
- `SRT.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) scheduling algorithm.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
git clone https://github.com/Shrajan8071/Scheduling-Algo-using-Cpp.git


2. **Compile and Run**:
Navigate to the directory containing the desired algorithm's file, compile it, and run the executable.


3. **Follow the On-screen Instructions**:
The program will prompt you to input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable). Follow the prompts to execute each scheduling algorithm.
